# 🛡️ Aetherium AntiCheat

Aetherium is a lightweight, modular AntiCheat system for Minecraft 1.8 servers built on Spigot. It is designed to detect common cheats like speed, reach, and more — while remaining efficient, configurable, and easy to maintain. 

**Note:** this is a personal project, I just made this for fun.
